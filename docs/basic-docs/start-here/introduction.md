# Introduction

Welcome to Komodo's Developer Documentation.

Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create and run fully independent blockchains in a secure and highly competitive environment.

## Komodo Mainnet
Komodo's mainnet chain features a subset of what is available to independent blockchain projects:

* Bitcoin-hash rate supported security

* Custom consensus modules

## Independent Blockchain Projects

Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:

* Bitcoin-hash rate supported security

* Zero-knowledge privacy

* Enterprise-level scalability

* Consensus-level smart contracts

* Inter-chain linking

* ...And more!

Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom, so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
